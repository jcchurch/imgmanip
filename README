imgmanip (lowercase) is a command line image manipulation tool
written in C that was used for my master's thesis. There is a
lot of undocumented code here and some day I'll finish it.

The program only works on PCX image files. Boring, I know. I
guess I should work on other file formates such as PNG
GIF or JPEG in the future.

There are two binary executables made by this project. First,
there's imgmanip. It's the image manipulation tool. Second,
there's imgCmp, which is short for "image comparison", which
reports a difference measure between two images passed on
the command line. The second program is probably out dated.

To build the program:

make

To install the program:

make install

The installation directory is the "bin" folder of your
home directory. If you don't like this, edit the Makefile
so that the OUT macro is set to your desired installation
point.
